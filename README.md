The Academics Tracker is a web based system that wishes to bridge the communications gap between guardians and teachers regarding dependents (students) in terms of attendance and academic progress in primary and high schools. In other words, the dependent gets an ongoing report on their dependents academic progress by getting constant updates on the dependent(s)’ assessment results.
In addition the guardian is assured on whether or not their dependent actually got to class as their attendance is also communicated in a timely fashion which also allowing the parent to know exactly when their dependent was absent from school. The objective is to get the guardian more involved in their dependent(s)’ academics such that they can help them do better in their academics should they need the extra push.
This system is a product of Monash South Africa and was developed by a group of their students as an Industrial Experience Project. To get the system for your school, please contact Monash University South Africa.
